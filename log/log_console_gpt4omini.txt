In the video, the operator appears to be using a web browser to check the weather and then inputting data into a spreadsheet application. The steps include:

1. **Checking Weather Information**: The operator navigates to a weather website, likely to gather current weather data, including temperature and conditions.
2. **Data Entry**: They input the gathered weather data into a spreadsheet, possibly for tracking or analysis purposes.
3. **Adjusting Data**: The operator seems to be updating or modifying the data as they go along, indicating a systematic approach to data collection.

Overall, the video showcases a process of collecting weather data and organizing it in a spreadsheet format.

Based on the frames from the video, here are the detailed steps of the process:

1. **Opening the Weather Website**: The operator opens a weather website (likely Baidu Weather) on the left side of the screen.

2. **Spreadsheet Preparation**: On the right side, a spreadsheet (possibly Google Sheets or Excel) is open, ready to receive weather data.

3. **Searching for Weather**: The operator enters the name of a city into the search bar on the weather website to retrieve the current weather information.

4. **Viewing Weather Data**: After searching, the weather information for the city appears, showing details like temperature, weather conditions, and forecasts.

5. **Recording Data**: The operator notes down the relevant weather data (such as temperature and conditions) from the website and inputs it into the corresponding cells in the spreadsheet.

6. **Repeating the Process**: The operator repeats the search for additional cities, entering each city's name into the search bar and recording the weather data in the spreadsheet.

7. **Finalizing Data Entry**: After all cities have been searched and their weather data recorded, the operator ensures that all information is accurately entered into the spreadsheet.

8. **Saving the Spreadsheet**: Finally, the operator saves the spreadsheet to preserve the entered weather data.

This process involves systematic searching, data retrieval, and documentation, ensuring that all relevant weather information is captured for multiple cities.

Based on the frames from the video, here are the detailed steps of the process:

1. **Initial Setup**: The operator opens a weather website on the left side of the screen and a spreadsheet on the right side.

2. **First City Search**:
   - The operator searches for the weather of the first city (not specified in the frames).
   - The temperature is displayed as 25°C.
   - The operator updates the corresponding cell in the spreadsheet (Column B) with the temperature result.

3. **Second City Search**:
   - The operator searches for the weather of the second city (not specified).
   - The temperature is displayed as 35°C.
   - The operator updates the corresponding cell in the spreadsheet with this temperature.

4. **Third City Search**:
   - The operator searches for the weather of the third city (not specified).
   - The temperature is displayed as 32°C.
   - The operator updates the corresponding cell in the spreadsheet with this temperature.

5. **Final Updates**:
   - The operator continues to check the weather for additional cities, updating the spreadsheet with the respective temperatures as they appear on the weather website.

Throughout the process, the operator consistently switches between the weather website and the spreadsheet, ensuring that the temperature data is accurately recorded for each city searched.

To find the weather for Yunnan using the method shown in the video, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. **Open the Weather Website**: Start by opening a web browser and navigating to a weather website (like Baidu Weather or any other reliable weather service).

2. **Access Your Spreadsheet**: Open the spreadsheet where you have the list of cities (in column A) and a space for the temperature results (in column B).

3. **Search for Yunnan**:
   - In the search bar of the weather website, type "Yunnan" and press Enter.
   - Wait for the page to load and display the weather information for Yunnan.

4. **Record the Temperature**:
   - Look for the current temperature displayed on the weather page.
   - Note the temperature (e.g., 25°C).

5. **Update the Spreadsheet**:
   - Go back to your spreadsheet.
   - Find the corresponding row for Yunnan in column A.
   - In column B, enter the temperature you noted from the weather website.

6. **Repeat if Necessary**: If you have more cities to check, repeat the process for each city listed in your spreadsheet.

By following these steps, you can efficiently gather and record weather information for Yunnan or any other city.

There are 6 buttons in the image.
There are 5 "Refresh" buttons in the image.
There are four tables on the right side of the image.
OK, Close
To determine the pixel coordinates of the "OK" button in the provided image, you would typically need to analyze the image visually or use image processing techniques. However, I can't analyze images directly.

If you have the image open, you can use a tool like a screenshot editor or an image viewer that shows pixel coordinates to find the exact location of the "OK" button. Generally, the coordinates will be in the format (x, y), where x is the horizontal position from the left and y is the vertical position from the top. 

If you can describe the position of the button relative to the corners or other elements in the image, I might be able to help you estimate its coordinates.
To find the pixel coordinates of cell A1 in the given Excel screenshot, we can use the provided information about the spreadsheet area boundaries and cell dimensions.

1. **Spreadsheet Area Boundaries**:
   - Top-Left Corner: (41, 261)
   - Bottom-Right Corner (Visible Grid): (2463, 1339)

2. **Cell Dimensions**:
   - Average Column Width: 90 pixels
   - Average Row Height: 20 pixels

3. **Cell A1 Position**:
   - A1 is the first cell in the first row and first column.

4. **Calculating the Coordinates**:
   - The top-left corner of the visible grid is at (41, 261).
   - The coordinates for cell A1 can be calculated as follows:
     - X-coordinate: 41 (top-left corner) + 0 (no offset for column A) = 41
     - Y-coordinate: 261 (top-left corner) + 0 (no offset for row 1) = 261

Thus, the pixel coordinates of cell A1 in the screenshot are **(41, 261)**.

That's it! Your first row should now be merged.
To merge the first row in your Excel spreadsheet, follow these steps:

1. **Select the Cells**: Click and drag to select the cells in the first row that you want to merge (e.g., A1, B1, C1).

2. **Merge Cells**:
   - Look for the "Merge & Center" button in the toolbar. It usually looks like two cells merging into one.
   - Click on it. You may have options like "Merge & Center," "Merge Across," or "Merge Cells." Choose "Merge & Center" if you want the text to be centered.

3. **Adjust Formatting** (if needed): After merging, you can adjust the font size, color, or alignment as desired.

4. **Save Your Work**: Don’t forget to save your changes.
